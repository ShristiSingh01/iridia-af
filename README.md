## Abstract

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained heart arrhythmia in adults. 
Holter monitoring, a long term 2-lead electrocardiogram, is a key tool available to cardiologists for AF diagnosis. 
Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have showed great capacity to automatically detect AF in ECG and their use as medical decision support tool is growing. 
The development and training of these models relies on the use of publicly available large annotated databases, that are limited, particularly in the case of public databases. 
In this study, we present a new Holter monitoring database from patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
The database contains 167 records from 152 patients, acquired from an outpatient cardiology clinic from 2006 to 2017 in Belgium.
The records last from 19 hours up to 96 hours, divided into 24-hour files. 
In total, it represents 24 million seconds of annotated Holter monitoring, sampled at 200 Hz. 
All the AF episodes were manually annotated and reviewed by an expert cardiologist and a specialist cardiac nurse. 
This dataset aims at expanding the available options for researchers working on AF detection
